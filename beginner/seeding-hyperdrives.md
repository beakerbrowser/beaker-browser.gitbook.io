# Seeding Hyperdrives

You can help keep other people's hyperdrives online by contributing bandwidth. This is called "seeding."

To seed a drive, visit the drive click on the peer-count on the right side of the URL bar. You will see a toggle. Switch it to the green "on" state.

You can turn off seeding by toggling the button again.

## Managing Seeded Hyperdrives

To see the drives you're currently seeding, open a new tab and click the ellipsis icon underneath your pinned bookmarks. In the menu, click the "Seeding" link.
